\begin{abstract}
    YouTube is the second most popular website on the internet. It brings in over 34.6 billion page views each
    month, most of which consist of videos being watched. Of those videos, 70\% are found through YouTube's
    recommendation algorithm. Unfortunately, this recommender system, like most, is sensitive to filter bubbles.
    In recent years, conspiracy content has been gaining popularity on the website, partially because of the way
    in which the algorithm handles it. To gain a better understanding of how the algorithm deals with
    conspiracies, an experiment was setup wherein brand-new YouTube accounts were made to watch conspiracy
    content adhering to different watch strategies. After watching fifteen conspiracy videos, all accounts ended
    up with significantly more conspiracy recommendations than the baseline. Accounts that watched conspiracy 
    videos that were recommended to them by YouTube ended up in filter bubbles especially quickly. While
    accounts ended up in a filter bubble after watching between three and six videos, getting out of a filter
    bubble took considerably longer. This suggests that YouTube's algorithm is indeed susceptible to the
    creation of filter bubbles consisting of conspiracy content.
