To do. 

\subsection{Research question}
This research will focus on the following research question:
\textit{What is the impact of different watch strategies on the number of conspiracy videos that have to be watched until a user's YouTube-recommendations start preferring conspiracy content?} In this scenario, 'preferring' will be defined as the situation in which the amount of conspiracy videos present in the recommendations is significantly higher than that of the baseline.

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent In order to answer the research question, three sub-questions will have to be answered. These questions are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How do different watch strategies on YouTube influence the type of content that is recommended to a user?
    \item How long does it take for a YouTube recommendations to stop preferring conspiracy videos, once they have started doing so?
    \item What type of classifier performs the best when it comes to labeling conspiracy videos on YouTube?
\end{itemize}
